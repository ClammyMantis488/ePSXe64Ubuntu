# ePSXe4Ubuntu - Alpha Release

Interactive script to install ePSXe and shaders on Ubuntu.

` Config --> Wizard Guide ` is not present - emailed developers ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru49bfyXijw)).

## HOW-TO

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandleesee/ePSXe4Ubuntu/master/e4u.sh

bash e4u.sh
```

Script will ask for SUDO password and eventually open GUI of ePSXe. 

**CLOSE** the ePSXe window to continue with the script. 

### Set-Up
